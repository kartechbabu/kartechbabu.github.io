<!-- 
I am an Assistant Professor of IT and Operations Management at Southern Methodist University's Cox School of Business. My research primarily investigates the societal and enterprise-level impacts of digitization and artificial intelligence, with a special focus on marginalized groups and underserved communities. At the societal level, I explore how digital technologies influence social and economic inequalities, working with organizations like the FCC and NTIA to inform policy initiatives aimed at bridging the digital divide. My work on education investigates the impact of digital and non-digital supplemental learning products, emphasizing the potential for mitigating digital inequality and enhancing educational equity.

At the enterprise level, my research explores how business leaders can leverage AI and analytics to optimize operations and enhance decision-making. I have ongoing projects that examine the use of generative AI tools in software development, focusing on how these tools affect both productivity and long-term software quality. Additionally, I have extensive experience collaborating with the cultural sector to study the effects of digitization, such as the impact of work-from-home trends on consumer behavior in the performing arts. My diverse research interests reflect my commitment to advancing both the theory and practical application of digital technologies in various sectors of society.

I have been recognized for my contributions to research and teaching with several prestigious awards. I received the C. Jackson Grayson Endowed Faculty Innovation Award from the Cox School of Business for excellence in teaching, and was nominated by students for the "Honoring Our Professors' Excellence" award in 2023. I have also been a Donna Wilhelm Research Fellow at SMU DataArts, where I studied the impact of digitization and AI/ML in the U.S. cultural sector. Additionally, I received a grant from the Marketing Science Institute to support my research on the performing arts industry. -->

Dr. Karthik Babu Nattamai Kannan is an Assistant Professor of Information Technology and Operations Management at Southern Methodist University’s Cox School of Business. He examines the impact of digitization and Artificial Intelligence (AI) on society and enterprises.

In his first stream of research, Dr. Kannan examines how digital technologies influence social and economic inequalities, with a particular emphasis on marginalized groups and underserved communities. His *Management Science* paper on the digital divide investigates whether improvements in mobile internet services, particularly access to unlimited data, can reduce digital inequality. The findings indicate that access to unlimited data disproportionately benefits disadvantaged households, leading to greater increases in educational and general data consumption compared to advantaged households. The **Federal Communications Commission** (FCC) invited Dr. Kannan to present and formally file this paper to inform **FCC proceeding #23-199 on "Data Caps in Consumer Broadband Plans."** In another study, he explores the policy debate on screen time by investigating the limits to the adoption of Technology-Mediated Learning (TML). The research revealed that while TML in schools increased demand for non-digital learning products, the adoption of digital products remained stagnant. These findings contribute to policy discussions about balancing digital and non-digital learning in education, with implications for managing screen time and supporting diverse learning needs. Dr. Kannan has also contributed to the **National Telecommunications and Information Administration’s** initiatives by evaluating grant proposals for the **Tribal Broadband Connectivity Program** and the **Connecting Minority Communities Pilot Program**. These programs, part of the federal government’s **broadband infrastructure plan**, aim to bring high-speed internet to rural and underserved areas.

At the enterprise level, Dr. Kannan explores how business leaders can leverage AI and analytics to optimize operations and enhance decision-making. In ongoing projects, he examines the use of generative AI tools in software development, focusing on how these tools affect productivity and long-term software quality. He served as a **Donna Wilhelm Research Fellow at SMU DataArts**, where he studied the impact of digitization and AI/ML in the U.S. cultural sector that directly related to policy priorities of the **National Endowment for the Arts**. Additionally, Dr. Kannan received a grant from the **Marketing Science Institute** to support his research on the effect of Work-from-home (remote work) on the demand for in-person performances in the non-profit cultural industry. His diverse research interests reflect a commitment to advancing both the theoretical and practical applications of digital technologies across various sectors of society.

Dr. Nattamai Kannan has been recognized for his contributions to research and teaching with several prestigious awards. For excellence in teaching, he received the C. Jackson Grayson Endowed Faculty Innovation Award from the Cox School of Business and was nominated by students for the “Honoring Our Professors’ Excellence” award in 2023. 

Dr. Nattamai Kannan holds a Ph.D. in Information Technology Management from the Scheller College of Business, Georgia Institute of Technology. Before transitioning to academia, Dr. Kannan provided technology consulting for Fortune 500 companies including GE, The Home Depot, Johnson & Johnson, and Citigroup. He has hands-on expertise in enterprise software development, having worked across the full Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) – from coding and system design to serving as an architect and manager. He is also a Sun Certified Java Programmer and is proficient in Python, R, and a wide range of data science tools, including big data technologies, further underscoring his technical expertise. This diverse experience honed his expertise in the strategic use of information technology within enterprises and its potential to drive organizational efficiency and societal improvement.

This is the front page of a website that is powered by the [Academic Pages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) and hosted on GitHub pages. [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com) is a free service in which websites are built and hosted from code and data stored in a GitHub repository, automatically updating when a new commit is made to the respository. This template was forked from the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) created by Michael Rose, and then extended to support the kinds of content that academics have: publications, talks, teaching, a portfolio, blog posts, and a dynamically-generated CV. You can fork [this repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) right now, modify the configuration and markdown files, add your own PDFs and other content, and have your own site for free, with no ads! An older version of this template powers my own personal website at [stuartgeiger.com](http://stuartgeiger.com), which uses [this Github repository](https://github.com/staeiou/staeiou.github.io).

A data-driven personal website
======
Like many other Jekyll-based GitHub Pages templates, Academic Pages makes you separate the website's content from its form. The content & metadata of your website are in structured markdown files, while various other files constitute the theme, specifying how to transform that content & metadata into HTML pages. You keep these various markdown (.md), YAML (.yml), HTML, and CSS files in a public GitHub repository. Each time you commit and push an update to the repository, the [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) service creates static HTML pages based on these files, which are hosted on GitHub's servers free of charge.

Many of the features of dynamic content management systems (like Wordpress) can be achieved in this fashion, using a fraction of the computational resources and with far less vulnerability to hacking and DDoSing. You can also modify the theme to your heart's content without touching the content of your site. If you get to a point where you've broken something in Jekyll/HTML/CSS beyond repair, your markdown files describing your talks, publications, etc. are safe. You can rollback the changes or even delete the repository and start over -- just be sure to save the markdown files! Finally, you can also write scripts that process the structured data on the site, such as [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb) that analyzes metadata in pages about talks to display [a map of every location you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html).

Getting started
======
1. Register a GitHub account if you don't have one and confirm your e-mail (required!)
1. Fork [this repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) by clicking the "fork" button in the top right. 
1. Go to the repository's settings (rightmost item in the tabs that start with "Code", should be below "Unwatch"). Rename the repository "[your GitHub username].github.io", which will also be your website's URL.
1. Set site-wide configuration and create content & metadata (see below -- also see [this set of diffs](http://archive.is/3TPas) showing what files were changed to set up [an example site](https://getorg-testacct.github.io) for a user with the username "getorg-testacct")
1. Upload any files (like PDFs, .zip files, etc.) to the files/ directory. They will appear at https://[your GitHub username].github.io/files/example.pdf.  
1. Check status by going to the repository settings, in the "GitHub pages" section

Site-wide configuration
------
The main configuration file for the site is in the base directory in [_config.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_config.yml), which defines the content in the sidebars and other site-wide features. You will need to replace the default variables with ones about yourself and your site's github repository. The configuration file for the top menu is in [_data/navigation.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_data/navigation.yml). For example, if you don't have a portfolio or blog posts, you can remove those items from that navigation.yml file to remove them from the header. 

Create content & metadata
------
For site content, there is one markdown file for each type of content, which are stored in directories like _publications, _talks, _posts, _teaching, or _pages. For example, each talk is a markdown file in the [_talks directory](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/_talks). At the top of each markdown file is structured data in YAML about the talk, which the theme will parse to do lots of cool stuff. The same structured data about a talk is used to generate the list of talks on the [Talks page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks), each [individual page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks/2012-03-01-talk-1) for specific talks, the talks section for the [CV page](https://academicpages.github.io/cv), and the [map of places you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html) (if you run this [python file](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.py) or [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb), which creates the HTML for the map based on the contents of the _talks directory).

**Markdown generator**

I have also created [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual markdown files that will be properly formatted for the Academic Pages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository.

How to edit your site's GitHub repository
------
Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons.

------
More info about configuring Academic Pages can be found in [the guide](https://academicpages.github.io/markdown/). The [guides for the Minimal Mistakes theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/configuration/) (which this theme was forked from) might also be helpful.
